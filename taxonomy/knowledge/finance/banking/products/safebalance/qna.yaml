      ## No bank overdraft fees

      We don't charge overdraft fees on this account. To help you avoid overdrawing your account, transactions will be declined and returned unpaid when you don't have enough money in your account.

      - If this happens, you won't be charged a bank overdraft fee, but the merchant or third party could charge you a fee. For example, you may be charged a late fee if the payment isn't received on time.
      - An owner can set up email or mobile alerts to notify you when you have a low balance in your account or when items aren't paid. (We don't charge for this service but your mobile carrier's message and data fees may apply. Delivery of alerts may be affected or delayed by your mobile carrier's coverage.)

      While this account prevents you from overdrawing in most cases, there may still be times when your account could have a negative balance, but we won't charge an overdraft fee. This could happen in the following ways:

      - When your debit card is authorized for one amount but the final amount is higher (for example, adding a tip at a restaurant or pumping gas)
      - A scheduled bill payment is deducted when you have insufficient funds in your account for the payment
      - When you get charged a fee, such as a monthly maintenance fee, and the current balance is less than the fee

      ## When your deposits are available

      - Cash, direct deposits and wire transfers: On the day we receive them. Direct deposit and wire transfers aren't available for SafeBalance ® for Family Banking accounts.
      - Checks you deposit: Usually the next business day, if deposited before the financial center or ATM cutoff time.
      - Mobile Check Deposits: Usually the next business day if deposited by applicable cutoff times. Please refer to Deposit Checks , then Help in the Mobile Banking app for additional details and terms and conditions.
      - If we place a hold on your deposit, we'll let you know the hold reason and when funds will be available for you to use. This is typically provided at the time of deposit but may also be mailed later. Deposits greater than $5,525 and checks deposited within the first 30 days of account opening may be held longer.
