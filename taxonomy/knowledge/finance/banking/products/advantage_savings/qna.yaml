      ## Interest rate policy

      Interest rate and interest calculation: Your account has a variable interest rate, which means the interest rate may change. Interest rates for your account are based on balance tiers, are set at our discretion and may change at any time without notice.

      To calculate interest, we apply a daily periodic rate to the collected balance in your account each day. The daily rate that applies will depend on which balance tier your end-of-day balance falls in. We compound and pay any interest earned monthly. Interest is only paid in whole cents and we use standard rounding rules to calculate the amount. This means that an amount less than half of one cent is rounded down to zero, and an amount of half of one cent or more is rounded up to the next whole cent.

      Extra interest: Extra interest is earned automatically when an account owner is enrolled in the Preferred Rewards program. The interest rate will increase by at least 5%, 10% or 20% over the standard rate, and is based on the Preferred Rewards tier in which you're enrolled. We may decide to pay a higher rate.

      Where can I find information about current interest rates?: You can find current rate information by checking bankofamerica.com, calling the number on your account statement or visiting a financial center.
