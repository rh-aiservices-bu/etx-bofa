      ## When your deposits are available

      - Cash, direct deposits, wire transfers: On the day we receive them.
      - Checks: Usually the next business day, if deposited before the financial center or ATM cutoff time.
      - Mobile Check Deposit: Usually the next business day if deposited by applicable cutoff times. Please refer to Deposit Checks , then Help in the Mobile Banking app for additional details and terms and conditions.
      - If we place a hold on your deposit, we'll let you know the hold reason and when your funds will be available. This is typically provided at the time of deposit but may also be mailed later. Deposits greater than $5,525 and checks deposited within the first 30 days of account opening may be held longer.

      ## How we post transactions

      The way we post transactions impacts your account balance. If there's not enough available money in your account to cover all of your transactions, the posting order can impact the number of overdraft fees you incur. At the end of each business day, we'll group transactions received that day into categories before posting them. Below are the most common categories, and common transaction types in each, in the order that they generally post to your account. Keep in mind that transactions that are still processing may lower your available balance.

      - Deposits: Added from highest to lowest dollar amount.
      - Many debit transactions: Subtracted based on the date and time you made them. If our system doesn't receive date and time of the transaction, they are posted and subtracted from highest to lowest dollar amount. These include one-time and recurring debit card transactions, one-time transfers, ATM withdrawals, and checks cashed with our tellers.
      - Other checks you wrote: Subtracted in check number order, unless our system cannot detect the check number; then, the check transactions are posted and subtracted from highest to lowest dollar amount.
      - Most other electronic payments and preauthorized transfers: Subtracted from highest to lowest dollar amount. These include scheduled transfers, online bill payments and preauthorized payments that use your account number.
      - Most fees: Subtracted from highest to lowest dollar amounts.

      ## Interest rate policy

      |     |  |
      | -------- | ------- |
      | Interest rate and interest calculation | Your account has a variable interest rate, which means the interest rate may change. Interest rates for your account are set at our discretion and may change at any time without notice. To calculate interest, we apply a daily periodic rate to the collected balance in your account each day. We compound and pay any interest earned monthly. Interest is only paid in whole cents and we use standard rounding rules to calculate the amount. This means that an amount less than half of one cent is rounded down to zero, and an amount of half of one cent or more is rounded up to the next whole cent. |
      | Interest rate booster | The interest rate booster is earned automatically when an account owner is enrolled in the Preferred Rewards program. The booster increases the interest rate by at least 5%, 10% or 20% over the standard rate, and is based on the Preferred Rewards tiers of Gold, Platinum and Platinum Honors, respectively. We may decide to pay a higher rate. |
      | Where can I find the current interest rate? | You can find the current interest rate by checking bankofamerica.com, calling the number on your account statement or visiting a financial center. |
