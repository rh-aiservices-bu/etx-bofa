      ## Overdraft policy

      - To help you avoid fees, we won't authorize ATM withdrawals or everyday debit card purchases when you don't have enough money in your account at the time of the transaction.
      - When we determine you don't have enough money in your account to cover other items such as checks or scheduled payments, we'll either authorize and pay the item and overdraw your account (an overdraft item), 1 or decline or return the item unpaid (a returned item). When this happens, you may be charged a fee. See details below.
      - We offer two overdraft setting options for how you want us to process your other transactions.

      ## How we post transactions

      The way we post transactions impacts your account balance. If there's not enough available money in your account to cover all of your transactions, the posting order can impact the number of overdraft fees you incur. At the end of each business day, we'll group transactions received that day into categories before posting them. Below are the most common categories, and common transaction types in each, in the order that they generally post to your account. Keep in mind that transactions that are still processing may lower your available balance.

      - Deposits: Added from highest to lowest dollar amount.
      - Many debit transactions: Subtracted based on the date and time you made them. If our system doesn't receive date and time of the transaction, they are posted and subtracted from highest to lowest dollar amount. These include one-time and recurring debit card transactions, one-time transfers, ATM withdrawals, and checks cashed with our tellers.
      - Other checks you wrote: Subtracted in check number order, unless our system cannot detect the check number; then, the check transactions are posted and subtracted from highest to lowest dollar amount.
      - Most other electronic payments and preauthorized transfers: Subtracted from highest to lowest dollar amount. These include scheduled transfers, online bill payments and preauthorized payments that use your account number.
      - Most fees: Subtracted from highest to lowest dollar amounts.
