      ## Storage and Destruction

      It is recommended that clients safeguard original items for 14 days using reasonable commercial standards for storage and in accordance with user documentation or local country restrictions, (if applicable). Reasonable standards include, but are not limited to storing the items in a secure location with limited access. Items should be destroyed using a cross cut shredder after 14 days or when all reasonable attempts to collect on the item have been made. The recommended timeframe for storage is subject to change without notice and failure to comply with safeguard and destruction measures that result in loss will be fully born by the client.

      You agree to cooperate with us fully to facilitate our adherence to guidance provided by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, including guidance concerning risk management of remote deposit capture. For this purpose, you agree that we may mandate specific internal controls at your locations audit your operations and/or request additional information. If a scanner is sent to your office in the U.S and/or Canada., it may not be shipped outside of the U.S. and/or Canada without express written approval by Bank of America.
