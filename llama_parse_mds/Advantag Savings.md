## Clarity Statement® — Overview of key policies and fees

### Your Bank of America Advantage Savings Account

**FDIC Coverage**  
This account is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and is backed by the U.S. government. The standard insurance amount is $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category.

**Monthly Maintenance Fee**  
**$8.00 each month**  
(We'll waive this fee for the first 6 months.)

You can avoid the Monthly Maintenance Fee when you meet **ONE** of the following requirements during each statement cycle:
- Maintain a minimum daily balance of $500 or more in your account, **OR**

- An owner of this account is under the age of 25 (fiduciary accounts don’t qualify), **OR**
- Be a member of the Preferred Rewards program. Learn more at bankofamerica.com/preferred-rewards, or visit your local financial center.

### Interest rate policy

**Interest rate and interest calculation**  
Your account has a variable interest rate, which means the interest rate may change. Interest rates for your account are based on balance tiers, are set at our discretion and may change at any time without notice.

To calculate interest, we apply a daily periodic rate to the collected balance in your account each day. The daily rate that applies will depend on which balance tier your end-of-day balance falls in. We compound and pay any interest earned monthly. Interest is only paid in whole cents and we use standard rounding rules to calculate the amount. This means that an amount less than half of one cent is rounded down to zero, and an amount of half of one cent or more is rounded up to the next whole cent.

**Extra interest**  
Extra interest is earned automatically when an account owner is enrolled in the Preferred Rewards program. The interest rate will increase by at least 5%, 10% or 20% over the standard rate, and is based on the tier of your Preferred Rewards program enrollment. We may decide to pay a higher rate.

**Where can I find current interest rates?**  
You can find current rate information by checking bankofamerica.com, calling the number on your account statement or visiting a financial center.

### When your deposits are available

- **Cash, direct deposits, wire transfers:** On the day we receive them.
- **Checks:** Usually the next business day if deposited before the financial center or ATM cutoff time.
- **Mobile Check Deposit:** Usually the next business day if deposited by applicable cutoff times. Please refer to Deposit Checks, then Help in the Mobile Banking app for additional details and terms and conditions.
- **If we place a hold on your deposit,** we’ll let you know the hold reason and when your funds will be available. This is typically provided at the time of deposit but may also be mailed later. Deposits greater than $5,525 and checks deposited within the first 30 days of account opening may be held longer.

### Overdraft policy

We don’t charge overdraft fees on this account. To help you avoid overdrawing your account, transactions will be declined and returned unpaid when you don’t have enough money in your account.

If this happens, you won’t be charged a bank overdraft fee, but the merchant or third party could charge you a fee. For example, you may be charged a late fee if the payment isn’t received on time.

There may still be times when your account could have a negative balance, but we won’t charge an overdraft fee.
