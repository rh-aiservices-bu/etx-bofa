# Overview of Rewards Money Market Savings key policies and fees

## Your Rewards Money Market Savings Account

### FDIC Coverage
This account is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and is backed by the U.S. government. The standard insurance amount is $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category. Refer to FDIC.gov/edie for more information.

### Monthly Maintenance Fee
- **$12.00 each month**

You can avoid the **Monthly Maintenance Fee** when you meet **one** of the following balance requirements during each statement period:
- Maintain a minimum daily balance of $2,500 or more, **OR**
- Link your account to your Bank of America Interest Checking® or Bank of America Advantage® account (waiver applies to first 4 savings accounts), **OR**
- Are enrolled in the Preferred Rewards® program (waiver applies to first 4 savings accounts)

## Withdrawal Limit Fee and Transaction Limitations

### Withdrawal Limit Fee

#### It Applies To
All types of withdrawals and transfers from a savings account, including:
- ATM withdrawals and transfers
- Financial center teller withdrawals
- Online and Mobile Banking transfers or payments
- Automatic or pre-authorized transfers (includes an automatic payment to a merchant or bank)
- Telephone transfers
- Checks, drafts or debit card transactions

#### How It Works
**Each monthly statement cycle:**
- You can make a total of 6 withdrawals and transfers with no Withdrawal Limit Fee
- After your first 6, the Withdrawal Limit Fee is **$10.00** for each additional withdrawal or transfer
- No more than 6 Withdrawal Limit Fees will be charged
- You can avoid the Withdrawal Limit Fee by maintaining a minimum daily balance of $2,500 or more in your savings account

(Effective for statement cycles that start on or after October 8, 2016, the minimum daily balance required to avoid the Withdrawal Limit Fee will be $20,000 or you must be enrolled in the Preferred Rewards® program.)

### Transaction Limitations
Certain types of withdrawals and transfers from a savings account, including:
- Online and Mobile Banking transfers or payments
- Automatic or pre-authorized transfers (includes an automatic payment to a merchant or bank)
- Telephone transfers
- Checks, drafts or debit card transactions

Certain types of withdrawals and transfers from savings accounts are limited to a total of 6 per monthly cycle. This limit is governed by federal Regulation D and our deposit agreement.

However, this limit doesn’t apply to transactions made at financial centers, by mail or at an ATM. (Please note that Withdrawal Limit Fees still apply to these types of transactions.)

**If you exceed the transaction limitations on more than an occasional basis, we’ll convert your account to a checking account that will no longer earn interest.**

## Interest rate policy

### Interest rate and interest calculation
Your account has a variable interest rate, which means the interest rate may change. Interest rates for your account are set at our discretion and may change at any time without notice.

To calculate interest, we apply a daily periodic rate to the collected balance in your account each day. We compound and pay any interest earned monthly. Interest is only paid in whole cents and we use standard rounding rules to calculate the amount. This means that an amount less than half of one cent is rounded down to zero, and an amount of half of one cent or more is rounded up to the next whole cent.

### Interest rate booster
The interest rate booster is earned automatically when an account owner is enrolled in the Preferred Rewards program. The booster increases the interest rate by at least 5%, 10% or 20% over the standard rate, and is based on the Preferred Rewards tiers of Gold, Platinum and Platinum Honors, respectively. We may decide to pay a higher rate.

### Where can I find the current interest rate?
You can find the current interest rate by checking bankofamerica.com, calling the number on your account statement or visiting a financial center.

# When your deposits are available

- **Cash, direct deposits, wire transfers:** On the day we receive them.
- **Checks:** Usually the next business day if deposited before the financial center or ATM cutoff time.
- **Mobile Check Deposit:** Usually the next business day if deposited by applicable cutoff times (please refer to "Help and Support" in Mobile App for additional details and terms and conditions).

If we place a hold on your deposit, we’ll let you know the hold reason and when funds will be available for you to use. This is typically provided at the time of deposit but may also be mailed later. Deposits greater than $5,000 and checks deposited within the first 30 days of your account opening may be held longer.

# Overdraft fees

- To help you avoid fees, we won’t authorize ATM withdrawals or everyday debit card purchases if you don’t have enough money in your account.
- When we determine that you don’t have enough money in your account to cover an item, then we either authorize and pay the item and overdraw your account (an overdraft item), or we decline or return the item unpaid (an NSF: returned item). When this happens, you’ll be charged a fee. See details below.
