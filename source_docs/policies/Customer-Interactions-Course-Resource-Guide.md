You have the power to shape the perceptions of your customers. They will base how they see your workplace on their interaction with you. That is why it is so important to have quality customer interactions.

## Act with empathy Introduction

Empathy is understanding the feelings of another person and showing that you understand their experiences and emotions. Acting with empathy shows customers that you understand what's important to them.

When you act with empathy, customers are more likely to:

- · Trust you and your expertise
- · Engage in better conversations
- · Open up about their life, needs and goals
- · Listen to your point of view
- · Consider you the next time they have a need
- · Refer you to others
- · Agree to connect with you again

## Relate to the customer

Relating to the customer can involve interacting with empathy based on the customer's language, energy and emotional state:

| Language                                                                                                                                                                                    | Energy                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Emotional state                                                                                                                  |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| · Mirror your customer's language. For example, if the customer says, 'Hey y'all,' don't respond with 'Hello sir.' · Use the right level of formality and avoid technical terms and jargon. | · Respond to your customer's energy and sense of urgency by empathizing. · For example, if the customer has a sense of urgency about the situation, show that you are taking the matter seriously and taking action right | · Be empathetic to your customer's emotional state. · For example, it may not be appropriate to smile if they are clearly upset. |

Journal prompt: Imagine you are meeting with a customer, and you notice their voice is louder than normal and their expression is angry. What can you do to relate to the customer?

<!-- image -->

Possible answer: Use empathetic statements to let the customer know you understand their frustration and let them know you are making it a priority to resolve the issue.

These are examples of statements that allow us to show empathy across differences when relating to the customer.

| Less empathetic                    | More empathetic                                                                                                      |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Calm down. You're overthinking it. | From what I hear, you are feeling … Is that right?                                                                   |
| At least you still have ...        | This is a difficult situation and I think you've shown a lot of  courage and strength in how you're handling things. |
| Here's what I would do.            | Thank you for trusting me with this. It means a lot to me.                                                           |

Here are some things to consider when relating to the customer:

- · Be relational, not transactional.
- · Use welcoming language.
- · Communicate with care.

## Communicate with care

## Make it easy

## Introduction

<!-- image -->

Make it easy for customers to do business because customers are most satisfied when something is easiest for them.

## What does it mean to make it easy?

We can make it easy for the customer by prioritizing and addressing their concerns, sharing next steps and focusing on long-term solutions. Here are some examples of those:

- · Prioritizing concerns: Asking the customer which issue they'd like resolved first
- · Addressing concerns: Doing whatever you can to help the customer while still following the guidelines
- · Sharing next steps: Letting the customer know what they need to do next
- · Focusing on long-term solutions: Showing the customer a more convenient way to perform a transaction

Journal prompt: Imagine you are working in a bank, and you notice that a certain customer comes in every day to ask for the balance of their checking account. How could you make it easier for the customer?

Possible answer: Show the customer how to check their balance online.
