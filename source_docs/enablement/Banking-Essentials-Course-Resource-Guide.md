**Banking, Markets and Finance** roles are client and customer facing. They are the types of jobs that people tend to think of when thinking about a bank, such as relationship banker.

There are also **Technology & Operations** roles support customer and client needs. From a technology perspective, roles run the gamut in terms of technology skills and areas of focus — from software engineers and developers to hardware and network experts to everything in between related to data science and cyber security.
