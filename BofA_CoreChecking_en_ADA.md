|--------------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Non-Bank of America ATMs | $2.50        | In the U.S., plus any fee charged by the ATM's operator      |
|                          | $5.00        | Outside the U.S., plus any fee charged by the ATM's operator |

- · To help you avoid fees, we won't authorize ATM withdrawals or everyday debit card purchases when you don't have enough money in your account at the time of the transaction.
- · When we determine you don't have enough money in your account to cover other items such as checks or scheduled payments, we'll either authorize and pay the item and overdraw your account (an overdraft item), 1 or decline or return the item unpaid (a returned item). When this happens, you may be charged a fee. See details below.
- · We offer two overdraft setting options for how you want us to process your other transactions.

## Overdraft settings and fees

Option 1: Standard - This setting will be automatically applied to your account.

- · Your checks and scheduled payments may be paid, causing an overdraft.
- · You may be charged an Overdraft Item Fee if you overdraw your account.
- · If we return an item unpaid, we won't charge a fee, but the payee may.

| Overdraft Item Fee                                       | $10.00   | We won't charge this fee:                                                                                            |
|----------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| (We won't charge you more than 2 of these fees per day.) | per item | · If your account is overdrawn by $1 or less  OR                                                                     |
|                                                          |          | · For items that are $1 or less  OR · On items that were authorized when your account had enough funds available  OR |

Option 2: Decline All - You can choose this setting if you would like to have your transactions declined or returned unpaid when you don't have enough money. With this setting you can avoid Overdraft Item Fees.

- · Checks or scheduled payments will be returned unpaid if you don't have enough money in your account.
- · If your account becomes overdrawn for any reason, we won't charge you an Overdraft Item Fee.
- · When we decline or return a transaction, we won't charge a fee, but the payee may.

Keep in mind, regardless of your overdraft setting, if you set up Balance Connect ® for overdraft protection, 2 we'll automatically transfer available funds from one or more of your linked backup accounts if you're about to overdraw your account.

Please see the Personal Schedule of Fees and Deposit Agreement and Disclosures for your account terms.

- 1. Our overdraft fee of $10 may apply for overdrafts created by check, recurring debit card transactions, or other electronic means. If your account is overdrawn, you must immediately bring your account to a positive balance. We pay overdrafts at our discretion and we reserve the right not to pay. For example, we typically do not pay overdrafts if your account is not in good standing.
- 2. Transfers from a linked (1) brokerage account enrolled in margin lending, (2) Loan Management Account ® , (3) credit card, or (4) line of credit and/or Home Equity Line of Credit are subject to interest charges and governed by the terms and conditions of the account.

Non-Bank of America

Teller Withdrawal

Per transaction, greater of $5.00 OR 3% of the amount (maximum $10.00) when you use your ATM or debit card, or card number, to make a withdrawal, transfer or payment at another bank and it is processed as a cash disbursement.

## When your deposits are available

- · Cash, direct deposits, wire transfers: On the day we receive them.
- · Checks: Usually the next business day, if deposited before the financial center or ATM cutoff time.
- · Mobile Check Deposit: Usually the next business day if deposited by applicable cutoff times. Please refer to Deposit Checks , then Help in the Mobile Banking app for additional details and terms and conditions.
- · If we place a hold on your deposit, we'll let you know the hold reason and when your funds will be available. This is typically provided at the time of deposit but may also be mailed later. Deposits greater than $5,525 and checks deposited within the first 30 days of account opening may be held longer.

## How we post transactions

The way we post transactions impacts your account balance. If there's not enough available money in your account to cover all of your transactions, the posting order can impact the number of overdraft fees you incur. At the end of each business day, we'll group transactions received that day into categories before posting them. Below are the most common categories, and common transaction types in each, in the order that they generally post to your account. Keep in mind that transactions that are still processing may lower your available balance.

- · Deposits: Added from highest to lowest dollar amount.
- · Many debit transactions: Subtracted based on the date and time you made them. If our system doesn't receive date and time of the transaction, they are posted and subtracted from highest to lowest dollar amount. These include one-time and recurring debit card transactions, one-time transfers, ATM withdrawals, and checks cashed with our tellers.
- · Other checks you wrote: Subtracted in check number order, unless our system cannot detect the check number; then, the check transactions are posted and subtracted from highest to lowest dollar amount.
- · Most other electronic payments and preauthorized transfers: Subtracted from highest to lowest dollar amount. These include scheduled transfers, online bill payments and preauthorized payments that use your account number.
- · Most fees: Subtracted from highest to lowest dollar amounts.
